# 📈 GenTech Proposal Process Optimization – Lean Six Sigma Case Study

This project applies the **Lean Six Sigma DMAIC methodology** to reduce inefficiencies in GenTech’s proposal creation process. GenTech, a $60B global tech company, was facing an 18% revenue drop due to slow, non-standardized processes. Our cross-functional team analyzed ERP data, identified root causes, and delivered data-driven solutions to reduce cycle time and improve competitiveness.

## 🎯 Project Objective

- **Goal**: Achieve a **15% reduction in proposal creation cycle time**
- **Scope**: All brands (X Series, Z Series, ESW, Consulting Services, SWG) across all regions
- **Focus Area**: Proposal creation process (not proposal content or strategy)

---

## 📦 Methodology – DMAIC Approach

| Phase     | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Define**   | Outlined problem scope and baseline cycle time |
| **Measure**  | Used ERP timestamp data to capture delays |
| **Analyze**  | Identified root causes: redundant approvals, poor hand-offs |
| **Improve**  | Proposed solutions to automate and streamline workflows |
| **Control**  | Designed control measures and KPIs to ensure sustained gains |

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Sigma Level: **2.08** → High defect rate (~30%)
- DPMO: **281,053** defects per million opportunities
- **ANOVA Tests**:
  - Geography and Brand significantly affect cycle time (p < 0.05)
  - North America had the most delays; Japan performed best
- **Correlation Analysis**:
  - Strong positive correlation between **bid size** (complexity) and cycle time

---

## 🧠 Root Causes

- Multiple hand-offs and unclear ownership
- Excessive manual approval loops
- Reconfigurations due to incomplete/inaccurate bid requests
- Region-specific inefficiencies (notably in North America)

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- ✅ Use **Japan as benchmark** for process efficiency
- ✅ Implement **automated KPIs** and tracking systems
- ✅ Standardize proposal templates and bid request formats
- ✅ Prohibit direct BSS submissions—ensure seller approval first
- ✅ Enforce SOPs and completeness checks before design hand-off
